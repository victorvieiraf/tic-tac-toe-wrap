# tic-tac-toe-wrap
Tic-tac-toe game with a wrapping twist.

Tic-tac-toe game made using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. Follows the same rules as normal Tic-tac-toe, but sides wrap around, similar to matrixes. This renders the game "undrawable", as the games where you would tipically draw now have victory conditions.
